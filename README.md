# checkMyMilk ü•õüêÆ
> Application to check if your milk is fine or not.

## Why this?
To help people to see in what state their milk is in at the moment by simply snapping a photo of it.
We believe too many people have zero knowledge about the well-being of their lactose products and there we decided to do something about it.

## How this?
It doesn't get much simpler:
1. Get your milk from the fridge
2. Snap a clear photo of it
3. Let us do the magic
4. Voil√†, here's how your milk is doing!

To-do list:
* Make image segmentation alg to retrieve freshness date
* Make image recognition to determine milk or not
* Make arch. for capturing camera image and tranfering to input
* Make funny result visualization with _spinning_ and __oval__ things!

## Status
Project is: very much _in progress_
